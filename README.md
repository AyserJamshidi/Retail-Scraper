# Retail-Scraper
This project was used in production for the Discord server "Out of Stonk" that peaked at 1,750 active users before taking the program down for its rewrite.

The rewrite, while taking a long time to create, is still utilizing Selenium and will also query website APIs through unofficial methods to save on processing power along with memory and data usage.

The rewrite is the repo [OutOfStonk](https://github.com/ayserjamshidi/OutOfStonk).  It is functional but is still very early in its creation.
